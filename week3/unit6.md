Follow the instructions below.

## Step 1. Create the message class 
In the behavior implementations, you will make use of your own _T100_ messages, raised by an own exception class. 
Therefore, you will first create the message class **`ZRAP_MSG_8001`** to define your own `T100` messages and the exception class **`ZCM_RAP_8001`**, where **`8001`** is your chosen suffix.

1.	Right-click on your package and choose _**New > Other ABAP Repository Object**_.
    ![Create the Message Class](images/w3u6_01_01.png)

2.	In the creation wizard, filter the entries with **`message`** and choose **`Message Class`**.   
    Then choose **Next >**.
    
    ![Create the Message Class](images/w3u6_01_02.png)
        
3.	Maintain **`ZRAP_MSG_8001`** as **name**, where **`8001`** is your chosen suffix, and a meaningful **description** (e.g. **`RAP messages`**) and choose **Next >**.
     
    ![Create the Message Class](images/w3u6_01_03.png)
    
4.	Assign a transport request and click **Finish**.
    
    ![Create the Message Class](images/w3u6_01_04.png)
    
    The new message class opens in the appropriate editor.
     
    ![Create the Message Class](images/w3u6_01_05.png)
    
5.	Create five messages with the numbers _001_ to _005_ and the short texts provided below.
    
    <table>
    <tr> <td>001</td> <td>Begin date &1 must not be after end date &2 for travel &3</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>002</td> <td>Begin date &1 must be on or after system date</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>003</td> <td>Customer &1 unknown</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>004</td> <td>Agency &1 unknown</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>005</td> <td>You are not authorized to perform this activity</td> </tr>
    </tr>
    </table> 

    Your message class should look as follows:
    
    ![Create the Message Class](images/w3u6_01_06.png)
    
6.	Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) the new message class to activate it.
    
## Step 2. Create the exception class.
Now, you will create the exception class **`ZCM_RAP_8001`**, where **`8001`** is your chosen suffix.
    
1.	Right-click on your package **`ZRAP_TRAVEL_8001`** and choose _**New > ABAP Class**_.
    
    ![Create the Exception Class](images/w3u6_02_01.png)
    
2.	Maintain **`ZCM_RAP_8001`** as **name** and a meaningful **description** (e.g. **`RAP Messages`**).
    
    Maintain **`CX_STATIC_CHECK`** as **Superclass** and then add **`IF_ABAP_BEHV_MESSAGE`** under **Interfaces**.
    
    Choose **Next >**.
    
    ![Create the Exception Class](images/w3u6_02_02.png)
    
3.	Assign a transport request and choose **Finish**.
    
    ![Create the Exception Class](images/w3u6_02_03.png)
    
    The ABAP class skeleton is generated and displayed in the appropriate editor.
     
    ![Create the Exception Class](images/w3u6_02_04.png)
    
4.	Define the constants for all 5 messages defined in the previously created message class in the **`PUBLIC SECTION`**.  
    
    For this, use the code snippet provided below for the purpose.
    Do not forget to replace the occurrences of the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.
    
    <pre>
        CONSTANTS:
          BEGIN OF date_interval,
            msgid TYPE symsgid VALUE 'ZRAP_MSG_8001',
            msgno TYPE symsgno VALUE '001',
            attr1 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE 'BEGINDATE',
            attr2 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE 'ENDDATE',
            attr3 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE 'TRAVELID',
            attr4 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
          END OF date_interval .
        CONSTANTS:
          BEGIN OF begin_date_before_system_date,
            msgid TYPE symsgid VALUE 'ZRAP_MSG_8001',
            msgno TYPE symsgno VALUE '002',
            attr1 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE 'BEGINDATE',
            attr2 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
            attr3 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
            attr4 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
          END OF begin_date_before_system_date .
        CONSTANTS:
          BEGIN OF customer_unknown,
            msgid TYPE symsgid VALUE 'ZRAP_MSG_8001',
            msgno TYPE symsgno VALUE '003',
            attr1 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE 'CUSTOMERID',
            attr2 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
            attr3 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
            attr4 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
          END OF customer_unknown .
        CONSTANTS:
          BEGIN OF agency_unknown,
            msgid TYPE symsgid VALUE 'ZRAP_MSG_8001',
            msgno TYPE symsgno VALUE '004',
            attr1 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE 'AGENCYID',
            attr2 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
            attr3 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
            attr4 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
          END OF agency_unknown .
        CONSTANTS:
          BEGIN OF unauthorized,
            msgid TYPE symsgid VALUE 'ZRAP_MSG_8001',
            msgno TYPE symsgno VALUE '005',
            attr1 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
            attr2 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
            attr3 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
            attr4 TYPE scx_attrname VALUE '',
          END OF unauthorized .
    </pre>
    
    Your source code should look as follows:
     
    ![Create the Exception Class](images/w3u6_02_05.png)

5.	Replace the method **`constructor`** in the class definition with the code snippet provided below.
    <pre>
        METHODS constructor
          IMPORTING
            severity   TYPE if_abap_behv_message=>t_severity DEFAULT if_abap_behv_message=>severity-error
            textid     LIKE if_t100_message=>t100key OPTIONAL
            previous   TYPE REF TO cx_root OPTIONAL
            begindate  TYPE /dmo/begin_date OPTIONAL
            enddate    TYPE /dmo/end_date OPTIONAL
            travelid   TYPE /dmo/travel_id OPTIONAL
            customerid TYPE /dmo/customer_id OPTIONAL
            agencyid   TYPE /dmo/agency_id  OPTIONAL.
    </pre>
    
    Your source code should look as follows:
     
    ![Create the Exception Class](images/w3u6_02_06.png)
    
6.	Define the required variables **`begindate`**, **`enddate`**,**`travelid`**, **`customerid`** and **`agencyid`** using the code snippet provided below.
    
    <pre>
        DATA begindate TYPE /dmo/begin_date READ-ONLY.
        DATA enddate TYPE /dmo/end_date READ-ONLY.
        DATA travelid TYPE string READ-ONLY.
        DATA customerid TYPE string READ-ONLY.
        DATA agencyid TYPE string READ-ONLY.
    </pre>
    
    Your source code should look as follows:
     
    ![Create the Exception Class](images/w3u6_02_07.png)
    
7.	Enhance the implementation of the method **`constructor`** by mapping the importing parameters to the properties.
    
    Insert the code snippet provided below at the end of the current method implementation.
        
    <pre>
        me->if_abap_behv_message~m_severity = severity.
        me->begindate = begindate.
        me->enddate = enddate.
        me->travelid = |{ travelid ALPHA = OUT }|.
        me->customerid = |{ customerid ALPHA = OUT }|.
        me->agencyid = |{ agencyid ALPHA = OUT }|.
    </pre>
    
    > Note: The alpha conversion is used for all parameters of type NUMC.
    
    Your source code should look as follows:
     
    ![Create the Exception Class](images/w3u6_02_08.png)
    
8.	Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the ABAP class.
    
## Step 3. Implement the behavior pool for the _Travel_ entity
You will now create and develop the behavior implementation (aka _behavior pool_) of the _travel_ entity **` ZI_RAP_Travel_8001`**, where **`8001`** is your chosen suffix.
    
1.	Open the base _behavior definition_ **`ZI_RAP_Travel_8001`** of your business object in the _Project Explorer_.
    
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Travel Entity](images/w3u6_03_01.png)
    
2.	Set the cursor on the behavior implementation class name **`zbp_i_rap_travel_8001`**,   
start the Quick Fix dialog using the shortcut **Ctrl+1**, and choose **`create…`** to generate the behavior implementation for the Travel entity. 
    
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Travel Entity](images/w3u6_03_02.png)
    
3.	In the appearing wizard, keep the defaulted fields and choose **Next >**.
_Project_, _Package_ and _Behavior Definition_ have been automatically assigned.
    
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Travel Entity](images/w3u6_03_03.png)
    
4.	Assign a transport request and choose **Finish**.
     
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Travel Entity](images/w3u6_03_04.png)
    
    The skeleton of the behavior implementation is generated and displayed in the editor.
    
     _**Global Class**_ and _**Local Types**_ tabs:  
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Travel Entity](images/w3u6_03_05.png)
    
    On the _**Global Class**_ tab, you can see the addition **`FOR BEHAVIOR OF`** which indicates that this class provides the behavior implementation of the specified business object - travel entity in the present case.  
    The proper implementation takes place on the _**Local Types**_ tab where the wizard has generated the local handler class **`lhc_hanler`** inheriting from cl_abap_behavior_handler.
    
5.	On the _**Local Types**_ tab, add the constants for the travel status in the **`PRIVATE SECTION`**:
    
    <pre>
        CONSTANTS:
          BEGIN OF travel_status,
            open     TYPE c LENGTH 1  VALUE 'O', " Open
            accepted TYPE c LENGTH 1  VALUE 'A', " Accepted
            canceled TYPE c LENGTH 1  VALUE 'X', " Cancelled
          END OF travel_status.
    </pre>
    
    Your source code should look as follows:
     
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Travel Entity](images/w3u6_03_06.png)
    
6.	Now, implement is the method **`acceptTravel`** which sets the overall status of _travel_ instances to _accepted_.
    
    For this insert the code snippet provided below into the method **` acceptTravel`**.  
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.
    
    First, set the _travel status_ of the _travel_ instances for all provided travel keys using an EML _modify_ statement.
    
    <pre>
        " Set the new overall status
        MODIFY ENTITIES OF zi_rap_travel_8001 IN LOCAL MODE
          ENTITY Travel
             UPDATE
               FIELDS ( TravelStatus )
               WITH VALUE #( FOR key IN keys
                               ( %tky         = key-%tky
                                 TravelStatus = travel_status-accepted ) )
          FAILED failed
          REPORTED reported.
    </pre>
        
    >**Please note:**  
    >The addition **`IN LOCAL MODE`** allows us to manipulate fields – e.g. to even change read-only fields – while skipping feature and authorization control.
        
    After modifying the _travel status_, the action needs to provide the result as defined in the behavior definition. In our present case, the result is **`$self`** which means, you must return the travel instance with all values for the given keys.
    
    <pre>
        " Fill the response table
        READ ENTITIES OF zi_rap_travel_8001 IN LOCAL MODE
          ENTITY Travel
            ALL FIELDS WITH CORRESPONDING #( keys )
          RESULT DATA(travels).

        result = VALUE #( FOR travel IN travels
                            ( %tky   = travel-%tky
                              %param = travel ) ).
    </pre>
    
    >**Excursus about the usage of `%tky`:**  
    >**`%tky`** stands for _transactional key_. 
    >- In non-draft use cases – like the present one –, **`%tky`** contains the same value as **`%key`** which is the key of the related entity.  
    >- In draft-enabled use cases, **`%tky`** will automatically contain the _is_draft_ indicator.    
    >You will handle the draft enablement in the next unit (i.e. week 3 unit 7).  
    >  
    >Therefore, using **`%tky`** in non-draft use case reduces the need for reworking your implementation when you enable the draft handling in your behavior definition as the code can cope with active as well as with draft instances.
        
    Your source code should look as follows:  
    
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Travel Entity](images/w3u6_03_07.png)
    
7.	The implementation of the action **`rejectTravel`** action is very similar to the **`acceptTravel`** action. It sets the travel status to _rejected_.
    
    For this, insert the code snippet provided below into the method **`rejectTravel`**.  
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.  
    You can make use of the _Source Code Formatter_ (**Ctrl+F1**) to format you code.  
    
    <pre>
        " Set the new overall status
        MODIFY ENTITIES OF zi_rap_travel_8001 IN LOCAL MODE
          ENTITY Travel
             UPDATE
               FIELDS ( TravelStatus )
               WITH VALUE #( FOR key IN keys
                               ( %tky         = key-%tky
                                 TravelStatus = travel_status-canceled ) )
          FAILED failed
          REPORTED reported.

        " Fill the response table
        READ ENTITIES OF zi_rap_travel_8001 IN LOCAL MODE
          ENTITY Travel
            ALL FIELDS WITH CORRESPONDING #( keys )
          RESULT DATA(travels).

        result = VALUE #( FOR travel IN travels
                            ( %tky   = travel-%tky
                              %param = travel ) ).
    </pre>
    
    Your source code should look as follows:
    
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Travel Entity](images/w3u6_03_08.png)
    
8.	You are now going to implement the validation **`validateAgency`** which checks the provided **`AgencyID`** on _save_ – when it is either modified in an existing instance or a new instance is created.  
    
    For this, insert the provided code snippet below into the method **`validateAgency`**.
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.
    
    Validation implementations typically start with reading the required data using EML.
    
    In the present case you have to read the **`AgencyID`** for the provided keys.
    
    <pre>
        " Read relevant travel instance data
        READ ENTITIES OF zi_rap_travel_8001 IN LOCAL MODE
          ENTITY Travel
            FIELDS ( AgencyID ) WITH CORRESPONDING #( keys )
          RESULT DATA(travels).
    </pre>
    
    Then derive an internal table with all distinct **`AgencyID`** and perform a _database select_ to validate the existence.  
    
    <pre>
        DATA agencies TYPE SORTED TABLE OF /dmo/agency WITH UNIQUE KEY agency_id.

        " Optimization of DB select: extract distinct non-initial agency IDs
        agencies = CORRESPONDING #( travels DISCARDING DUPLICATES MAPPING agency_id = AgencyID EXCEPT * ).
        DELETE agencies WHERE agency_id IS INITIAL.

        IF agencies IS NOT INITIAL.
          " Check if agency ID exist
          SELECT FROM /dmo/agency FIELDS agency_id
            FOR ALL ENTRIES IN @agencies
            WHERE agency_id = @agencies-agency_id
            INTO TABLE @DATA(agencies_db).
        ENDIF.
    </pre>
             
    And finally loop over the travel table, check whether an **`AgencyID`** has been provided and if it exists, and raise state messages if an invalid **`AgencyID`** was provided.  
    
    If the **`AgencyID`** is either empty or does not exist in the check-table, a message is raised using our exception class.
    When you make use of the so-called state messages, you first need to clear existing messages for the _state area_ of this instance and then raise new ones – if required.   
    
    >**Please note:**  
    > State messages are important in the context of _draft_ where the messages are stored together with the state of the instance. In a non-draft use-case, state messages are translated into transient messages by the framework.  
    
    <pre>
        " Raise msg for non existing and initial agencyID
        LOOP AT travels INTO DATA(travel).
          " Clear state messages that might exist
          APPEND VALUE #(  %tky               = travel-%tky
                           %state_area        = 'VALIDATE_AGENCY' )
            TO reported-travel.

          IF travel-AgencyID IS INITIAL OR NOT line_exists( agencies_db[ agency_id = travel-AgencyID ] ).
            APPEND VALUE #( %tky = travel-%tky ) TO failed-travel.

            APPEND VALUE #( %tky        = travel-%tky
                            %state_area = 'VALIDATE_AGENCY'
                            %msg        = NEW zcm_rap_8001(
                                              severity = if_abap_behv_message=>severity-error
                                              textid   = zcm_rap_8001=>agency_unknown
                                              agencyid = travel-AgencyID )
                            %element-AgencyID = if_abap_behv=>mk-on )
              TO reported-travel.
          ENDIF.
        ENDLOOP.
    </pre>
    
    At the end, your source code should look as follows:  
    
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Travel Entity](images/w3u6_03_09.png)
    
9.	You are now going to implement the validation **`validateCustomer`** which checks the provided **`CustomerID`** on _save_ – when it is either modified in an existing instance or a new instance is created.   

    The implementation of the corresponding method **`validateCustomer`** follows a very similar approach as for the **`validateAgency`** method.
    
    You will read the **`CustomerID`**, check its existence on the database table and raise state messages if an invalid value was provided.  
      
    For this, insert the code snippet provided below into the method **`validateCustomer`**.  
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.  
      
    <pre>
       " Read relevant travel instance data
        READ ENTITIES OF zi_rap_travel_8001 IN LOCAL MODE
          ENTITY Travel
            FIELDS ( CustomerID ) WITH CORRESPONDING #( keys )
          RESULT DATA(travels).

        DATA customers TYPE SORTED TABLE OF /dmo/customer WITH UNIQUE KEY customer_id.

        " Optimization of DB select: extract distinct non-initial customer IDs
        customers = CORRESPONDING #( travels DISCARDING DUPLICATES MAPPING customer_id = CustomerID EXCEPT * ).
        DELETE customers WHERE customer_id IS INITIAL.
        IF customers IS NOT INITIAL.
          " Check if customer ID exist
          SELECT FROM /dmo/customer FIELDS customer_id
            FOR ALL ENTRIES IN @customers
            WHERE customer_id = @customers-customer_id
            INTO TABLE @DATA(customers_db).
        ENDIF.

        " Raise msg for non existing and initial customerID
        LOOP AT travels INTO DATA(travel).

11.	Now, let’s go with implementing the determinations. First, you are going to implement the determination **`setInitialStatus`** which sets the _travel status_ to open when a new _travel_ instance is created.   
    
    The implementation will read the travel status for all provided keys and sets the status to open for those that don’t have a status yet.
    
    >**Please note:**  
    > Determinations need to be idempotent – which means the result may not differ even if they are executed multiple times for the same key.
      
    For this, insert the code snippet provided below into the method **`setInitialStatus`**.  
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.  
    
    <pre>

    Your source code should look as follows:
    
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Travel Entity](images/w3u6_03_12.png)
    
12.	Now you are going to implement the determination **`calculateTravelID`** which is used as an example to demonstrate a determination on _save_ and to provide a readable _travel identifier_. But please note, the key of the travel business object is still the **`TravelUUID`**.  
      
    Instead of using a number range, the present implementation simply fetches the highest existing _travel ID_ from the database table and increases the value by _1_.    
    Please note that this approach does not ensure gap free or unique IDs.  
        
    For this, insert the code snippet provided below into the method **`calculateTravelID`**.  
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.  
    
    <pre>

    Your source code should look as follows:  
     
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Travel Entity](images/w3u6_03_13.png)
    
13.	Now, you are going to implement the determination **`calculateTotalPrice`**  which is an on-Modify determination for the fields **`BookingFee`** and **`CurrencyCode`** – i.e. it is triggered anytime these fields are changed.  
    
    The implementation will call the internal action **`recalcTotalPrice`** for all provided travel keys.  
    
    For this, insert the code snippet provided below into the method **`calculateTotalPrice`**.  
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.  
    
    <pre>
      MODIFY ENTITIES OF zi_rap_travel_8001 IN LOCAL MODE

            EXECUTE recalcTotalPrice
            FROM CORRESPONDING #( keys )
          REPORTED DATA(execute_reported).

        reported = CORRESPONDING #( DEEP execute_reported ).
    </pre>
    
    The internal action **`recalcTotalPrice`** calculates the _total price_ by looping over all bookings, collecting all _flight prices_ (**`FlightPrice`**) and adding the _booking fee_ (**`BookingFee`**). In case of different currency codes, it also performs a currency conversion.   
        
    Reading the _booking_ instances for a _travel_ instance takes place via a _read-by-association_.    
        
    The implementation uses the ABAP statement **`collect`** to build an internal table with all occurring currency codes while summing up values for already existing ones. This is done for all _booking_ instances belonging to a _travel_ instance. This internal table is then added to the **`TotalPrice`**, using an AMDP (ABAP Managed Database Procedure) to convert amounts with different currency codes. Finally, the calculated **`TotalPrice`** is updated using EML.  
    
    For this, insert the code snippet provided below into the method **`recalcTotalPrice`**.  
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.

15.	Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the behavior implementation.
    
## Step 4. Implement the behavior pool for the _Booking_ entity
You will now create and develop the behavior implementation (aka _behavior pool_) of the _booking_ entity **`ZCL_I_RAP_Booking_8001`**, where **`8001`** is your chosen suffix.  
    
1.	Go back to the base _behavior definition_ **`ZI_RAP_Travel_8001`** of your business object in the _Project Explorer_.    
    Set the cursor on the behavior implementation class name **`zcl_i_rap_booking_8001`**,   
    start the _Quick Fix_ dialog using the shortcut **Ctrl+1**, and choose **`create…`** to generate the behavior implementation for the Travel entity.  
    
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Booking Entity](images/w3u6_04_01.png)
    
2.	In the appearing wizard, keep the defaulted fields and choose **Next >**.  
     
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Booking Entity](images/w3u6_04_02.png)
    
3.	Assign a transport request and choose **Finish**.  
    
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Booking Entity](images/w3u6_04_03.png)
    
    The skeleton of the behavior implementation is generated and displayed in the editor.  
    
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Booking Entity](images/w3u6_04_04.png)
    
4.	First implement the determination **`calculateBookingID`** which is performed on _Modify_ when a new instance is created.
    For this, insert the code snippet provided below into the method **`calculateBookingID`**.  
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.

5.	The **`calculateTotalPrice`** determination calls the internal action **`recalcTotalPrice`** which we defined and implemented on root level.  
    
    For this, insert the code snippet provided below into the method **`calculateTotalPrice`**.  
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.  
    
    <pre>
        " Read all travels for the requested bookings.
        " If multiple bookings of the same travel are requested, the travel is returned only once.
        READ ENTITIES OF ZI_RAP_Travel_8001 IN LOCAL MODE
        ENTITY Booking BY \_Travel
          FIELDS ( TravelUUID )
          WITH CORRESPONDING #( keys )
          RESULT DATA(travels)
          FAILED DATA(read_failed).

        " Trigger calculation of the total price
        MODIFY ENTITIES OF ZI_RAP_Travel_8001 IN LOCAL MODE
        ENTITY Travel
          EXECUTE recalcTotalPrice
          FROM CORRESPONDING #( travels )
        REPORTED DATA(execute_reported).

        reported = CORRESPONDING #( DEEP execute_reported ).
    </pre>
       
      Your source code should look as follows:  
    
    ![Implement the Behavior Pool – Booking Entity](images/w3u6_04_06.png)
    
6.	Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the behavior implementation.
        
## Step 5. Define the Authorization master
Now you are now going to add authorization control to your business object.  
For that, you will first have to enhance the base _Behavior Definition_ accordingly.  
    
1.	In the _Project Explorer_, Open the base _behavior definition_ **`ZI_RAP_Travel_8001`** where **`8001`** is your chosen suffix.  
     
    ![Define the Authorization Master](images/w3u6_05_01.png)
    
2.	Uncomment the **`authorization master ( instance )`** statement line to declare the _travel_ root node as authorization master.   
    Instance-specific authorization requests are directed to the implementation of the authorization master.   
    <pre>authorization master ( instance ) </pre>
    
    Your source code should look as follows:
    
    ![Define the Authorization Master](images/w3u6_05_02.png)
    
3.	Now, scroll down to the _booking_ entity and uncomment the authorization dependent line and specify the association **`_Travel`**.    
    <pre>authorization dependent by _Travel</pre>

    This declares the _booking_ entity as authorization dependent. Modifying requests on the _booking_ entity are directed to the authorization master following the provided association.  
    
    Your source code should look as follows:  
    
    ![Define the Authorization Master](images/w3u6_05_03.png)
    
4.	Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the behavior definition.
    
## Step 6. Implement the Authorization master
You are now going to implement the authorization master in the behavior implementation of the _travel_ entity **`ZI_RAP_Travel_8001`**, where **`8001`** is your chosen suffix.   
     
1.	First, remain in your base BO behavior definition **`ZI_RAP_Travel_8001`**.   
    Set the cursor on the **`master`** keyword of the authorization master declaration statement and use the _Quick Fix_ (**Ctrl+1**) to add the new method declaration to the behavior implementation.  
    
    ![Implement the Authorization Master](images/w3u6_06_01.png)
    
    >**Please note:**  
    >This pattern works for other declarations as well. If you for instance add a new action, you can use the _Quick Fix_ feature (**Ctrl+1**) to let the ABAP Development Tools generate the corresponding method declaration as well as an empty method implementation.
    
2.  Since you can’t influence the actual authorizations in the trial ABAP environment, you need to simulate if a certain authorization – for instance the update authorization – is present or not.   
    This is done via some helper methods that we first need to declare.  
    
    For this, insert the code snippet provided below at the end of the local handler class definition **`lhc_Travel`** of the behavior implementation of the _travel_ entity.   
    
    <pre>   
   
       METHODS is_update_granted IMPORTING has_before_image      TYPE abap_bool
                                            overall_status        TYPE /dmo/overall_status
                                  RETURNING VALUE(update_granted) TYPE abap_bool.

       METHODS is_delete_granted IMPORTING has_before_image      TYPE abap_bool
                                            overall_status        TYPE /dmo/overall_status
                                  RETURNING VALUE(delete_granted) TYPE abap_bool.

       METHODS is_create_granted RETURNING VALUE(create_granted) TYPE abap_bool.
    </pre>
    
    Your source code should look as follows:
     
    ![Implement the Authorization Master](images/w3u6_06_02.png)
        
3.	Make use of the ADT Quick Fix (**Ctrl+1**) to generate the implementations for all four methods.  
    
    ![Implement the Authorization Master](images/w3u6_06_03.png)
    
    You will now go ahead and implement the different methods. The helper classes will perform authority checks using the authority object **` ZOSTAT8001`** that was defined in the previous week. **`8001`** is your chosen suffix.  
    
4.	First, implement the helper method **`is_create_granted`** which checks if the _create_ operation is allowed. This operation corresponds to the activity **`01`**.   
      
    For testing purposes, we set the result to `true` in all cases. This can of course be adjusted for testing different situations.

    For this, insert the code snippet provided below into the method **`is_create_granted`**.   
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.   
    
    <pre>
        AUTHORITY-CHECK OBJECT 'ZOSTAT8001'
          ID 'ZOSTAT8001' DUMMY
          ID 'ACTVT' FIELD '01'.
        create_granted = COND #( WHEN sy-subrc = 0 THEN abap_true ELSE abap_false ).
        " Simulate full access - for testing purposes only! Needs to be removed for a productive implementation.
        create_granted = abap_true.
    </pre>
    
    Your source code should look as follows:  
    
    ![Implement the Authorization Master](images/w3u6_06_04.png)
    
5. Now, implement the helper method **`is_update_granted`** which checks if the _update_ operation is allowed. This operation corresponds to the activity **`02`**.   
    
    For this, insert the code snippet provided below into the method **`is_update_granted`**.   
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.   
    
    <pre>
        IF has_before_image = abap_true.
          AUTHORITY-CHECK OBJECT 'ZOSTAT8001'
            ID 'ZOSTAT8001' FIELD overall_status
            ID 'ACTVT' FIELD '02'.
        ELSE.
          AUTHORITY-CHECK OBJECT 'ZOSTAT8001'
            ID 'ZOSTAT8001' DUMMY
            ID 'ACTVT' FIELD '02'.
        ENDIF.
        update_granted = COND #( WHEN sy-subrc = 0 THEN abap_true ELSE abap_false ).

        " Simulate full access - for testing purposes only! Needs to be removed for a productive implementation.
        update_granted = abap_true.
    </pre>
    
    In case a record is already present, the **`travel_status`** of the before image is used in the check.  
    
    ![Implement the Authorization Master](images/w3u6_06_05.png)
    
6.	Now, implement the helper method **`is_delete_granted`** which checks if the _delete_ operation is allowed. This operation corresponds to the activity **`06`**.    
    
    For this, insert the code snippet provided below into the method **`is_delete_granted`**.  
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.  
    
    <pre>
        IF has_before_image = abap_true.
          AUTHORITY-CHECK OBJECT 'ZOSTAT8001'
            ID 'ZOSTAT8001' FIELD overall_status
            ID 'ACTVT' FIELD '06'.
        ELSE.
          AUTHORITY-CHECK OBJECT 'ZOSTAT8001'
            ID 'ZOSTAT8001' DUMMY
            ID 'ACTVT' FIELD '06'.
        ENDIF.
        delete_granted = COND #( WHEN sy-subrc = 0 THEN abap_true ELSE abap_false ).

        " Simulate full access - for testing purposes only! Needs to be removed for a productive implementation.
        delete_granted = abap_true.
    </pre>
    
    ![Implement the Authorization Master](images/w3u6_06_06.png)
    
7. You can now implement the **`get_authorizations`** method.  
    It simulates the use case of using an editable field - **`TravelStatus`** in the present case – for controlling the authorization.     Therefore, the implementation reads the before image from the active persistence and uses this value when calling the helper methods.  
        
    For this, insert the code snippet provided below into the method **`get_authorizations`**.  
    Do not forget to replace the placeholder **`8001`** with your chosen suffix.  
    
    <pre>
       DATA: has_before_image    TYPE abap_bool,
              is_update_requested TYPE abap_bool,
              is_delete_requested TYPE abap_bool,
              update_granted      TYPE abap_bool,

    The various options via the **`requested_authorizations`** structure are mapped to the activity values (_create_, _update_ and _delete_) defined in the authorization object. These are then checked for each _travel_ instance.  
    
    The result table is put together based on the outcome of the respective authorization checks.  
    
    ![Implement the Authorization Master](images/w3u6_06_07.png)
    
8.	Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) and activate ![activate icon](images/adt_activate.png) the behavior implementation.
    
## Step 7. Preview the enhanced Travel app & Play around
You are now done with the behavior implementations and can run and check the enhanced SAP Fiori elements Travel App.    
    
1.	Start the _Travel app_ in your service binding **`ZUI_RAP_TRAVEL_O2_8001`** – where **`8001`** is your chosen suffix – or refresh (**`F5`**) it in the browser.   
    Provide your ABAP user credentials if requested.   
    
    First you see the two new actions _Accept Travel_ and _Reject Travel_ beside the create, update and delete operations. Both actions are toggled based on the _status_ of the selected travel instance.  
    
    Press **Go** on the UI to load the back-end data.  
      
    ![Preview the enhanced Travel App](images/w3u6_07_01.png)
    
    ![Preview the enhanced Travel App](images/w3u6_07_02.png)
    
2.	Feel free to play around with your app.  
    For example:
    -  Create a new Travel record.  
    Provide some inconsistent values for the _Agency ID_, the _Customer ID_ and the _Begin date_ and/or the _End date_.  
    When you click on _save_, the corresponding error messages are shown.  
    -	Correct the values and click on _save_.  
    Now the validations are passed successful. You also see that the determinations were executed. The _Travel ID_ was calculated and the _Booking status_ was defaulted.  
    -	Use the actions _Accept_ and _Reject_ to verify the instance specific feature control.  
    -	On the Travel Object Page:  
    In the _Booking_ table on the _Travel_ object page, click on _create_ to create a new _booking_ instance for this travel. 
    Provide some valid entries and click _save_.   
    Navigating back shows that the header instance was not reloaded and therefore the old _Total price_ is shown. This would require the definition of a side-effect which we are not covering in this session. A manual refresh of the UI shows the updated Total Price.  
    -	You can click on _delete_ to delete the Travel instance.  
        
## Summary
You have completed the exercise!   
In this unit, you have learned  
-	How to create the BO behavior pool class and how to implement the business object-specific logic for your app in ABAP using determination, validations and actions.  
-	How the dynamic feature control enhances the user experience and how to implement it.  
- How to implement the authorization master.  
    
## Solution
Find the source code of the created message class, exception class, behavior implementation classes (aka _behavior pools_)  and the enhanced CDS behavior definition in the **[/week3/sources](/week3/sources)** folder:  
- [W3U6_MSAG_ZRAP_MSG_8001](/week3/sources/W3U6_MSAG_ZRAP_MSG.txt)
