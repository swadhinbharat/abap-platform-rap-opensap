# HANDS-ON EXERCISE FOR WEEK 2 UNIT 4: CREATING CDS DATA MODEL PROJECTION

## Previous exercise
[Week 2 Unit 3: Creating the Core Data Services (CDS) Data Model](unit3.md)

## Introduction
In the present hands-on exercise, you will define the CDS data model projection for your travel app on top of the CDS data model defined in the previous exercise. 
With projection views, you can expose only those elements that are relevant for the specific service. You can de-normalize the underlying data model and  also define fine-tuning such as virtual elements, value helps, search and UI semantics.
    
You can watch [week 2 unit 4: Creating the CDS Data Model Projection](https://open.sap.com/courses/cp13/items/49GF6acceUwItzEuJoffCP) on the openSAP platform.

Follow the instructions below.

## Step 1. Create the Travel Projection View

First, create the Travel BO projection view (aka consumption view) **`ZC_RAP_Travel_8001`** (where `8001` is your chosen suffix)  for the Travel entity.

1. Right-click on your travel BO view (aka interface view) **`ZI_RAP_Travel_8001`** and choose **New Data Definition** from the context menu.
 
    ![Create Travel BO projection view](images/w2u4_01_01.png)

2.  Maintain **`ZC_RAP_Travel_8001`** as name and a meaningful description (e.g. _**Travel BO projection view**_) in the creation wizard and choose **Next >** to continue.   
The project, the package and the referenced object have been automatically assigned in the creation wizard. 


    >**Please note**    
    >In this course, we will follow the naming convention of the Virtual Data Model (VDM) of the SAP S/4HANA where the name of interface or BO views begins with _`<namespace>I`_ (e.g _`ZI_`_) and the name of consumption or projection views begins with the namespace followed by _`<namespace>C`_ (e.g. _`ZC_`_).

3. Assign a transport request and choose **Next >**.  

    ![Create Travel BO projection view](images/w2u4_01_03.png)

4. Choose the **`Define Projection View`** template from the list and then choose **Finish**.

    ![Create Travel BO projection view](images/w2u4_01_04.png)


    The new data definition appears in the editor. 


    ![Create Travel BO projection view](images/w2u4_01_05.png)
    
    
    **Short Explanation:**    
    The travel BO view is specified as projection view and all view elements have been automatically inserted in the projection list between the curly brackets.

5. Replace the travel data definition in the editor with the code snippet provided below and replace all occurrences of **`8001`** with your chosen suffix. You can make use of the _Replace All_ feature (**Ctrl+F**) in ADT for the purpose.

    Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) the changes, but **DO NOT** yet activate the travel BO projection view.

    You can make use of the Source Code Formatter (**Shift+1**) to format the source code.
    <pre>
    @EndUserText.label: 'Travel BO projection view'
    @AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #CHECK
    @Search.searchable: true
    @Metadata.allowExtensions: true

    define root view entity ZC_RAP_Travel_8001
      as projection on ZI_RAP_Travel_8001 as Travel
    {
      key TravelUUID,
          @Search.defaultSearchElement: true
          TravelID,
          @Consumption.valueHelpDefinition: [{ entity: { name: '/DMO/I_Agency', element: 'AgencyID'} }]
          @ObjectModel.text.element: ['AgencyName']
          @Search.defaultSearchElement: true
          AgencyID,
          _Agency.Name       as AgencyName,
          @Consumption.valueHelpDefinition: [{ entity: { name: '/DMO/I_Customer', element: 'CustomerID'} }]
          @ObjectModel.text.element: ['CustomerName']
          @Search.defaultSearchElement: true
          CustomerID,
          _Customer.LastName as CustomerName,
          BeginDate,
          EndDate,
          @Semantics.amount.currencyCode: 'CurrencyCode'
          BookingFee,
          @Semantics.amount.currencyCode: 'CurrencyCode'
          TotalPrice,
          @Consumption.valueHelpDefinition: [{ entity: { name: 'I_Currency', element: 'Currency'} }]
          CurrencyCode,
          Description,
          TravelStatus,
          LastChangedAt,
          LocalLastChangedAt,

          /* Associations */
          _Agency,
          _Booking : redirected to composition child ZC_RAP_Booking_8001,
          _Currency,
          _Customer   
    }
    </pre>

    The data definition should look as follows. 

    ![Create Travel BO projection view](images/w2u4_01_06.png)
    
    **Short explanation: What has changed?**
    - The alias **`Travel`** is specified for the projected view
    - The keyword **`root`** is specified in the **`DEFINE`** statement to specify the projected Travel BO as root node.
    - The view annotations **`@Metadata.allowedExtension`** is specified before the **`DEFINE`** statement to allow the projection view to be enhanced with separate metadata extensions 
    - The view annotations **`@Search.Searchable`** is specified before the **`DEFINE`** statement to allow the projection view to enable the full-text (aka freestyle) search.
    - The freestyle search is enabled for the view elements **`TravelID`**, **`AgencyID`** and **`CustomerID`** using the annotation **`@Search.DefaultSearchElement`**.
    - The view elements **`AgencyName`** from the association **`_Agency`** and **`CustomerName`** from the association **`_Customer`** have been added to the projection list.
    They are specified as  textual description for the view elements **`AgencyID`** and **`CustomerID`** respectively using the **`@ObjectModel.text.element`** annotation.
    - Value helps are specified for the view elements **`AgencyID`**, **`CustomerID`**, and **`CurrencyCode`** using the annotation **`@Consumption.valueHelpDefinition`**. 
    The name of the target CDS entity that acts as a value help provider and the name of its element that is linked to the local element have to be specified. 
    - The view element **`CurrencyCode`** is specified as the reference field for the currency fields **`BookingFee`** and **`TotalPrice`** using the **`@Semantics.amount.currencyCode`**  annotations. 
    - The view elements **`CreatedBy`**, **`CreatedAt`** and **`LastChangedBy`** have been removed from the projection list because they only have an are administrative function and will be of no use in our scenario. The view elements **`LastChangedAt`** and **`LocalLastChangedAt`** remain in the projection list because they will be used for the transactional enablement of Your Travel List Report App in week 3 â€“ especially for the implementation of the optimistic lock.
    - associations have been exposed in the projection list
    - association to the booking BO child node (**`_Booking`**) has been redirected to the appropriate Booking BO projection view using the **`redirected to composition child`**  statement.    
         
    An error is currently displayed for this statement, because the specified Booking BO projection view **`ZC_RAP_Booking_8001`** does not yet exist. 
    
## Step 2. Create the Booking Projection View
Now, you will create the missing Booking BO projection view (aka consumption view) **`ZC_RAP_BOOKING_8001`** for the Booking entity - where **`8001`** is your chosen suffix.

1. Right-click on your Booking BO view (aka interface view) **`ZI_RAP_BOOKING_8001`** and choose **New Data Definition** from the context menu.
 
    ![Create Booking BO projection view](images/w2u4_02_01.png)

2.  Maintain **`ZC_RAP_BOOKING_8001`** as name and a meaningful description (e.g. _**Booking BO projection view**_) in the creation wizard and choose **Next >** to continue.  
    The project, the package and the referenced object have been automatically assigned in the creation wizard.  
 
    ![Create Booking BO projection view](images/w2u4_02_02.png)

3. Assign a transport request and choose **Next >**. 
 
    ![Create Booking BO projection view](images/w2u4_02_04.png)

4. Choose the **`Define Projection View`** template from the list and then choose **Finish**.

    ![Create Booking BO projection view](images/w2u4_02_05.png)

    The new data definition appears in the editor.
 
    ![Create Booking BO projection view](images/w2u4_02_06.png)

    **Short Explanation:**
    The booking BO view is specified as projection view and all view elements have been automatically inserted in the projection list between the curly brackets.

5. Replace the booking data definition in the editor with the code snippet provided below and replace all occurrences of **`8001`** with your chosen suffix. You can make use of the _Replace All_ feature (**Ctrl+F**) in ADT for the purpose.

    Save ![save icon](images/adt_save.png) the changes, but **DO NOT** yet activate the booking BO projection view.

    You can make use of the Source Code Formatter (**Shift+1**) to format the source code.
    
    <pre>
    @EndUserText.label: 'Booking BO projection view'
    @AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #CHECK
    @Search.searchable: true
    @Metadata.allowExtensions: true

    define view entity ZC_RAP_Booking_8001
      as projection on ZI_RAP_Booking_8001 as Booking
    {
      key BookingUUID,
          TravelUUID,
          @Search.defaultSearchElement: true
          BookingID,
          BookingDate,
          @Consumption.valueHelpDefinition: [{ entity : {name: '/DMO/I_Customer', element: 'CustomerID'  } }]
          @ObjectModel.text.element: ['CustomerName']
          @Search.defaultSearchElement: true
          CustomerID,
          _Customer.LastName as CustomerName,
          @Consumption.valueHelpDefinition: [{entity: {name: '/DMO/I_Carrier', element: 'AirlineID' }}]
          @ObjectModel.text.element: ['CarrierName']
          CarrierID,
          _Carrier.Name      as CarrierName,
          @Consumption.valueHelpDefinition: [ {entity: {name: '/DMO/I_Flight', element: 'ConnectionID'},
                                               additionalBinding: [ { localElement: 'CarrierID',    element: 'AirlineID' },
                                                                    { localElement: 'FlightDate',   element: 'FlightDate',   usage: #RESULT},
                                                                    { localElement: 'FlightPrice',  element: 'Price',        usage: #RESULT },
                                                                    { localElement: 'CurrencyCode', element: 'CurrencyCode', usage: #RESULT } ] } ]
          ConnectionID,
          FlightDate,
          @Semantics.amount.currencyCode: 'CurrencyCode'
          FlightPrice,
          @Consumption.valueHelpDefinition: [{entity: {name: 'I_Currency', element: 'Currency' }}]
          CurrencyCode,
          LocalLastChangedAt,

          /* associations */
          _Travel : redirected to parent ZC_RAP_Travel_8001,
          _Customer,
          _Carrier,
          _Connection,
          _Flight
    }
    </pre>

    The data definition now looks as follows. 
    
     ![Create Booking BO projection view](images/w2u4_02_07.png)

    **Short explanation: What has changed?**  
    -	The alias Booking is specified for the projected view
    -	The view annotations **`@Metadata.allowedExtension`** is specified before the **`DEFINE`** statement to allow the projection view to be enhanced with separate metadata extensions 
    -	The view annotations **`@Search.Searchable`** is specified before the **`DEFINE`** statement to allow the projection view to enable the full-text (aka freestyle) search.
    -	The view columns **`BookingID`** and **`CustomerID`** are enabled for freestyle search.  
    The view elements **`CustomerName`** and **`CarrierName`** from the associations **`_Customer_`** and **`_Carrier`** respectively have been added to the projection list.  
    They are specified as  textual description for the view elements **`CustomerID`** and **`CarrierID`** respectively using the annotation **`@ObjectModel.text.element`**.  
    -	Value helps are specified for the view elements **`CustomerID`**, **`CarrierID`**, **`ConnectionID`** and **`CurrencyCode`** using the annotation **`@Consumption.valueHelpDefinition`**.  
    In the value help definition of the element **`ConnectionID`**, an additional binding condition is defined for returning values from the selected value help record for the local view elements **`CarrierID`**, **`FlightDate`**, **`FlightPrice`** and **`Currency`**.
    -	The view element **`CurrencyCode`** is specified as reference field for the currency field **`FlightPrice`**. 
    -	The view elements **`CreatedBy`** and **`LastChangedBy`** have been removed from the projection list because they only have an administrative function and will be of no use in our scenario. The view element **`LocalLastChangedAt`** remains in the projection list because it will be used for the transactional enablement of Your Travel List Report App in week 3 â€“ especially for the implementation of the optimistic lock.  
    -	All associations have been exposed in the projection list.
    -	The association to the travel BO parent node has been redirected to the appropriate Travel BO projection view using the  **`redirected to parent`**  statement. 

## Step 3. Activate the CDS Data Model Projection & Run the Data Preview 
To avoid error during the activation, both new CDS interface views â€“ i.e. Travel view and Booking view â€“ must be activated together for the first time.  

1.	Choose **`Activate All`** ![activate all icon](images/adt_activate_all.png) or use the shortcut **Ctrl+Shift+F3**.    
    Select both CDS views **`ZC_RAP_TRAVEL_8001`** and **`ZC_RAP_BOOKING_8001`** on the appearing dialog, and choose **Activate**.
 
    ![Activate CDS Data Model Projection](images/w2u4_03_01.png)

    Your projected CDS data model consisting of the Travel BO projection view and the Booking BO projection view are now activated, but warnings are displayed in the _Problems_ view. The reason behind this is that the authority check is allowed for these CDS views (using the view annotation **`@AccessControl.authorizationCheck: #CHECK`**), but no CDS access control is yet defined for them.    
             
    You will work on this in unit 7 of week 2 where you will implement a basic CDS access control.
         
 
    ![Activate CDS Data Model Projection](images/w2u4_03_02.png)

2.	To run the Data Preview, choose one of the CDS views - i.e. **`ZC_RAP_TRAVEL_8001`** or **`ZC_RAP_BOOKING_8001`** - in the Project Explorer or open it in the editor, and press **F8**.   
       
    The data preview will open in the editor area.
